## poc_update_smart_contracts

### Background / Context
**Goal/user story:**
As long as platform Forus is in development, it will come in handy to be able to update deployed smart contracts without the necessity to communicate new contract addresses to users/developers. The goal of this poc is to create a (set of) smart contract(s) that serve as a gateway to a smart contract with the actual functionality. 
**More info:**
The technical term for this procedure is dubbed *proxy contracts*

### Hypothesis:
If users interface with a gateway contract, functionality can be upgraded by deploying a new functionality contract, and changing the to_address in the gateway contract.
