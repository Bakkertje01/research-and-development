# poc-validator-generic-ui
### v0.1

## Asignee: [jamalv](https://github.com/jamalv)

## Background / Context
**Goal:** To create a concept for a generic user interface for the validator role as defined [on this page](https://foundation.forus.io/en/platform/).

## Method
The designs will go trough phases, each with their own focus. 

1. Technical: The first focus of the UI POCs is to align the engineering efforts. Based on the designs we can make a prototype combining the technical POCs with the user interface POCs. 

2. User experience: When we made a technical prototype we will start focussing on improving the user experience.

## Result
The result of this POC is a dashboard that enables the user to validate information of other users in the form of "key" - "value" pairs. An example of this can be "birthdate" - "10-08-1992". The user can do a validation themselves or request validation from another user.

In this first itteration we used the more technical terms to describe user inteface elements, such as showing ethereum addresses and "key" "value". This is to communicate to the engineers what is expected of each UI element.

## Recommendation
To build a prototype without worrying about the visual appeal and user experience. A simple bootstrap user interface will suffice. We will learn a lot from interacting with the first prototypes and will make changes. Spending time on design in this stage would be inneficient.
