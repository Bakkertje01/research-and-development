## About
The goal of this repository is to create and improve the building blocks of [Platform Forus](#) or any other fully decentralized platform.

## POC stages
Every POC goes trough stages marked with the following <kbd>labels</kbd>  

First, an **issue** is created:  
1: <kbd>[proposal](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aproposal)</kbd> ([example-issue](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues/36))  
2: <kbd>[fill-template](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afill-template)</kbd> ([example-template](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/blob/master/workflow_template.md))  
3: <kbd>[unassigned](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3Aunassigned%20)</kbd>

Then, when the issue is assigned, the assignee can create a **feature branch** with a **project folder** and a **readme** where the POC can be built and documented. ([example-project](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/tree/poc0-example/poc0-example)) 
 
4: <kbd>[work-in-progress](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3Awork-in-progress%20)</kbd>  
5: <kbd>[waiting-for-review](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Awaiting-for-review)</kbd>   
6: <kbd>[completed](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Acompleted%20)</kbd>
