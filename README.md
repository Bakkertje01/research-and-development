## Goal

The goal of this repository is to learn and share knowledge around decentralized development. We are researching, creating and improving the building blocks of [Platform Forus](https://foundation.forus.io/en/platform/) and any other fully decentralized platform/application.

## Getting started

Every project folder contains a readme describing its contents. The [wiki](https://github.com/teamforus/research-and-development/wiki) contains general information, [issues](https://github.com/teamforus/research-and-development/issues) are for making and discussing proposals, [branches](https://github.com/teamforus/research-and-development/branches/all) show what is currently being worked on. 

## Workflow

Most projects start out as **issues**:  
1: <kbd>[proposal](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aproposal)</kbd>  
2: <kbd>[fill-template](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afill-template)</kbd> ([issue-template](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/blob/develop/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md))  
3: <kbd>[unassigned](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3Aunassigned%20)</kbd>

Then, when the issue is assigned, the assignee can create a **feature branch** with a **project folder** and a **readme** where it can be built and documented ([example-project](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/tree/poc0-example/poc0-example)). Comment your project name and number [here](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues/51).  
 
4: <kbd>[work-in-progress](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3Awork-in-progress%20)</kbd>  
5: <kbd>[waiting-for-review](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Awaiting-for-review)</kbd>   
6: <kbd>[completed](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Acompleted%20)</kbd>
