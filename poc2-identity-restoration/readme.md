### Background / Context
**Goal/user story:** As a user I want to be able to recover my identity in case I lost my private key
When a user loses his private key, he should be able to recover his wallets by assigning validators. Validators can assign a new address to an identity when the user loses its private key, so that a new public key can be attached.
