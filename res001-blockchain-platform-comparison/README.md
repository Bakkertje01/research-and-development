# Research: Blockchain platform comparison

A comparison between blockchain platform. 

## Hypothesis:
There is alot of hype around Ethereum. 

### Longlist

Public blockchain platform
---
- Blockchain
- Ethereum
- EOS
- NEO
- NEM


Private blockchain platform
---
- Multichain      
- Hyperledger    
- COCO           
- IBM Blockchain  


### Shortlist Public

- Rootstock (Bitcoin doesnt support building dApps, checking out sidechain rootstock instead.)
- Ethereum
- EOS
- NEO


### Shortlist Private

- Multichain      
- Hyperledger     
- COCO            
- IBM Blockchain  



### Method

#### Public Platform Market Cap

| Name       | Market Cap          | Circulating supply  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Bitcoin      | $284,762,874,568 | 16,736,225 BTC |
| Ethereum     | $55,638,467,164  | 96,292,534 ETH |
| NEM          | $4,797,107,999   | 8,999,999,999 XEM * |
| EOS          | $2,568,238,641   | 534,548,018 EOS *	 |
| NEO          | $2,453,256,000   | 65,000,000 NEO * |

*Not Mineable

#### Backers

##### Rootstock, company
RSK Labs, a New York based company

##### Ethereum, non-profit
Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA)

##### EOS, company
block.one, Dan Larrimer (STEEM, BitShares)

##### NEO, company
Onchain, chinese investers

##### NEM, non-profit
NEM.io foundation founded in Singapore, non-profit

#### Consensus mechanism
##### Rootstock
Proof of Work. Rootstock is a Sidechain of Bitcoin and can be merge-mined.
The merge-mining functionality allows Bitcoin miners to mine in both chains with almost no extra cost. This will provide them extra revenues based on fees and allow them to participate in the smart contracts business.
##### Fueling the blockchain (incentive)
##### Programming language
##### Community / Audience
##### Scalability
