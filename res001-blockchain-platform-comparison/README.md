# Research: Blockchain platform comparison

A comparison between blockchain platform. 

##### List of terms

Proof of Stake PoS - A type of algorithm which uses network consensus to handle fault tolerance.

Proof of Work PoW - A type of algorithm which uses computing power to handle fault tolerance.

Byzantine Fault BF - A failure in which a node remains functional, but operates in a dishonest manner.

## Hypothesis:
There is alot of hype around Ethereum. 


#### Public

- Rootstock (Bitcoin doesnt support building dApps, checking out sidechain rootstock instead.)
- Ethereum
- EOS
- NEO


#### Shortlist Private

- Multichain      
- Hyperledger     
- COCO            
- IBM Blockchain  



## Method

- Funders, developers
- Consensus Mechanism
- Incentive
- Programming language
- Community
- Scalability

### Funders, developers

##### Rootstock, company
RSK Labs, a New York based company

##### Ethereum, non-profit
Ethereum Foundation, Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA)

##### EOS, company
block.one, Dan Larrimer (STEEM, BitShares)

##### NEO, company
Onchain, chinese investers

##### NEM, non-profit
NEM.io foundation founded in Singapore, non-profit

### Consensus mechanism
#### Rootstock, PoW
Proof of Work. Rootstock is a Sidechain of Bitcoin and can be merge-mined.
The merge-mining functionality allows Bitcoin miners to mine in both chains with almost no extra cost. This will provide them extra revenues based on fees and allow them to participate in the smart contracts business.

#### Ethereum, PoW
Proof of Work.

#### EOS, dPoS
Delegated Proof of Stake. Under dPoS, those who hold tokens on a blockchain adopting the EOS.IO software may select block producers through a continuous approval voting system and anyone may choose to participate in block production and will be given an opportunity to produce blocks proportional to the total votes they have received relative to all other producers.

#### NEO, dBFT
Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance. dBFT protocol occurs through a “gamified” form of block verification among professional node operators. All of these professional nodes are appointed by ordinary nodes through a delegated voting process. The professional node broadcasts its version of the blockchain to the network. If 66% of the other nodes agree with the information, consensus is achieved. Should this threshold not be met, a different professional node is appointed to broadcast its blockchain version until consensus can be established.

#### NEM, PoI
Proof of Importance. PoI is the algorithm used in NEM to time stamp transactions. A NEM user's importance is determined by how many coins they have and the number of transactions made to and from their wallet. POI uses the NCDawareRank network centrality measure, the topology of the transaction graph, as well as a number of other relevant signals to achieve consensus.

### Fueling the blockchain (incentive)

#### Rootstock

#### Ethereum

#### EOS

#### NEO

#### NEM

### Programming language Smart Contracts

#### Rootstock, Solidity

#### Ethereum, Solidity

#### EOS, C++

#### NEO, C# and Java 

#### NEM, any language off-chain
"Smart Contracts are not on blockchain. This is by design as on chain smart contracts have posed serious risk for other blockchains, have presented scalability issues, and can lead to too much resources being wasted on the deployment of it. For NEM, smart contracts can be executed off chain, such as on company servers, and the transactions can be recorded on the blockchain through the NEM API. Instead on chain smart contracts, the below customizable smart assets can be used on chain." 

### Community

| Name       | Twitter         | Reddit  | Github Contributors |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|-----:|
| Rootstock      | 13k | 443 | 17 |
| Ethereum     | 229k  | 194k | 200 |
| EOS          | 148k   | 4k	 | 51 |
| NEO          | 85k   | 44k | 17 |
| NEM          | 43k  | 10k | 3 |
