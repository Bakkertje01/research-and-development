# poc-testnet
### v0.0

## Background / Context
**Goal/user story:** It would be useful to have a testnetwork to deploy to. But the ethereum networks are often unstable due to spam etc. If this network works well, it could also be used while platform Forus cannot go fully public yet.

**More:** The go-ethereum team released a tool called Puppeth to easily (hopefully) set up a testnet including monitoring, explorers, faucets and wallets. Presentation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5RcjYPTG9g
