## How to contribute

### Looking for a new project to pick up?  
Look no further than the <kbd>[unassigned](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3Aunassigned%20)</kbd> issues. If you found one you like then comment your project number and name [here](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues/51), create a **feature branch** with a **project folder** and a **readme** where you can build it ([example-project](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/tree/poc0-example/poc0-example)).

### Want to help prepare a project?  
Look for issues with the <kbd>[fill-template](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afill-template)</kbd> label and make suggestions in the comments. 

### Is there a project you'd like to see?  
Simply open an issue. Better yet, also fill the [template](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/blob/develop/template.md).

### Want to contribute to a project?
Look for the <kbd>[help-wanted](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)</kbd> label, or just look at the [branches](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/branches) or <kbd>[work-in-progress](https://github.com/teamforus/proofs-of-concept/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Awork-in-progress)</kbd> label to see what's being worked on.
